# Client-Server Architecture
A architecture in which the **client** ***requests*** a service from a **server**. The **server** then sends a ***response*** for a given **client**'s ***request*** to provide the required service.

As an example, a Internet Browser acts as a **client** agains a Web Server, which act as a **server**. Both ***requests*** and ***responses*** may be exchanged under a defined protocol: the [[20210126234319]] HyperText Transfer Protocol.
